        When multiplexing, resolve model/provider/context inside the profile
        serving ``source`` — otherwise the banner advertises the base config's
        model while the session actually runs on the profile's (#59003).
        Mirrors ``_run_agent``'s gating so single-profile gateways never
        enter the scope.

        Call via ``asyncio.to_thread`` from async handlers: under the scope,
        resolution can do blocking work (credential refresh, context-length
        HTTP probes) that must not run on the event loop. The scope is entered
        inside this method, so contextvars behave correctly in the worker
        thread.
